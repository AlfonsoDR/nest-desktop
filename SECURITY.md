# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

The NEST Desktop is research oriented software and as such is expected to
run mainly in well protected environments. In case it is found that this
software can be used to violate security mechanisms, developers will try to
provide patches that mitigate the risk of this misuse.

The current policy is explained in SECURITY.md in the nest-desktop main branch.
The policy can also be found at <https://github.com/nest-desktop/nest-desktop/security/policy>.

## Supported Versions

Generally only the latest version will receive security related updates.
Currently the following versions are being supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 3.2.x   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| < 3.2   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

For reporting a vulnerability please create a security advisory on the
nest-desktop/nest-desktop [Security
Advisories](https://github.com/nest-desktop/nest-desktop/security/advisories)
page.
You need a GitHub account to create an advisory.

Developers will then contact the reporter in a timely manner to assess
severity and further handling via [Security
Advisories](https://github.com/nest-desktop/nest-desktop/security/advisories)
or as normal [Issue](https://github.com/nest-desktop/nest-desktop/issues) in
non-critical cases.
