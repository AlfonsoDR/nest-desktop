        We will learn how to systematically explore the biophysics of neurons, synapses and small scale networks via numerical simulations.
        For this purpose, we will employ the simulation software NEST. For more information on the features of this research tool, see
        <a href="http://www.nest-simulator.org/" target="_blank"><pre>http://www.nest-simulator.org/</pre></a>
        Currently, NEST comes in version 2.18.0.
        <a href="https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator/releases/" target="_blank"><pre>https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator/releases/</pre></a>
        There are several possibilities to set up NEST simulations.
        A particularly popular method makes use of an interface to the multi-purpose programming language Python, called PyNEST.
        Any NEST simulation script then looks like a Python program, enhanced by some new commands provided by the interface to communicate with the simulation kernel in both directions.

        A graphical user interface: NEST Desktop
      </mat-card-title>
      <mat-card-content>
        For the purpose of this course, we will use a graphical user interface (GUI) called NEST Desktop
        <a href="https://github.com/babsey/nest-desktop" target="_blank"><pre>https://github.com/babsey/nest-desktop</pre></a>
        This tool also allows us to perform numerical simulations written in NEST. In contrast to PyNEST, though, the GUI gives you direct access to many important features of NEST in a highly intuitive fashion, without the need to dive into the
        details of designing, writing and debugging the underlying programs.

        How to prepare a protocol of the course
      </mat-card-title>

        <p>
          Step by step, you will perform simulation experiments of increasing complexity, following the assignments.
          Your task is then to carefully document what you do, why you do it, and what came out of it,
          using precise language and appropriate terminology.
          In addition, you will need to select and extract meaningful illustrations and parameter tables describing the simulation.
        </p>

        <b>How can you achieve this?</b> Simulations with NEST Desktop can be protocolled,
        and the outcome can be exported to a document processor of your choice,
        LibreOffice or LaTeX would both be two excellent options for this task.
        The protocol you write can easily be enhanced and illustrated with the PDF/SVG figures you exported from your simulations.

        <p>As a final step, you will export your protocol to a single PDF file and submit it by email.</p>

        <p>Generally, please make sure your protocol is concise, complete and correct.
          If you are unsure how to write a protocol that meets scientific standards, please consult appropriate resources before you start.
          For each assignment, you should separately address the following four aspects:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>What is the scientific question or problem that is addressed by the simulation?</b>
            Make sure you use correct terminology in your descriptions. Also make sure you keep neurobiological aspects
            and mathematical modeling concepts apart.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Which exact simulation setup was used to answer this question?</b>
            List and describe all its components (e.g. neurons, devices), specify how they are connected together (e.g. electrodes, synapses),
            and provide tables of all relevant parameters. Additional drawings may be instrumental.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>What was the outcome of the simulations performed?</b>
            You should select a meaningful set of figures to underpin what you think is the outcome of your simulations.
            In most cases, you will use them to illustrate your text-based description of the role of a specific parameter
            for the behavior of the system in question (e.g. a neuron, a network).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>What are your conclusions in view of the simulation results?</b>
            Based on the simulation results you obtained, you should go back to the original question and
            formulate an answer to it. Again, make sure you distinguish aspects of biology and biophysics,
            and possible issues (e.g. shortcomings) of the numerical model you simulated.
          </li>
        </ol>
